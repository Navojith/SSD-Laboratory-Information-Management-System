#### Brief Description of Project - 
Medi Line is a small, independently owned and operated laboratory located in
Athurugiriya. The laboratory was founded in 2016. The laboratory focuses on providing
routine clinical laboratory services such as hematology, biochemistry, and clinical
chemistry to locals.
The need for building a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) for Medi
Line arose as the laboratory is currently using a file-based system to track and manage
most of their information.
Our LIMS is designed to manage and organize laboratory data and workflows. The
system typically includes features such as data collection, data storage, data analysis, and
reporting capabilities.
The LIMS is important to the laboratory because it is specially curated for their
requirements. It helps to improve the efficiency and accuracy of laboratory operations.
By providing a centralized location for data storage and management, the LIMS makes it
easier to access and analyze data, which can help to improve decision-making and
research outcomes.
